> Libertad, carajo!!

The human being has the right of humanity, the human being has the right of freedom of thinking and action, unless that action is explicitly harming someone

The human being has the right of knowledge, which is necessary to the aquisition of capital through services or products offering, in that way the capital is used to consume and with this grow the surrounding economy

Libertad, carajo!!!
